# Advanced Calculator with User Interface

## 📌 Overview
This project is an **Advanced Calculator** with a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built using Python.  
It supports **basic arithmetic**, **scientific operations**, and **mathematical constants** like π, e, and τ.  
The interface makes it easy for users to perform both simple and advanced calculations in an intuitive way.
